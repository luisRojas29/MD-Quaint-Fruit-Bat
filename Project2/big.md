####The font size attribute

Previous to HTML5 font size could be specified by a value of 1 -7.

Example:

	<font size="4">This is some text!</font>

Using the big tag would increase the font size by one, such as from font-size 4 to font-size 5.  The font-size attribute has been removed from the HTML5 specification and the big tag was removed with it.
