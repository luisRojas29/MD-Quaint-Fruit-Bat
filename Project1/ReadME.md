##UI/UX Creation using CSS

FOLDERS:

1.  Images
	- Images that are processed and either complete or good enough for testing.  Integrated into the HTML code/ Webpage.
2. Scalable_GFX
	- Vector based images which allow for further editing/tweaking without quality loss.
3. Original_Images
	- Source Images before they were modified, in the event we have to start over with an image.

#Assignment Parameters
---

After looking through the assignment again, we are supposed to create our UI/UX while anything that's interactive will be added in the next JavaScript course.  I will list issues that probably need JavaScript first, and then things we can work on now in HTML/CSS.

#Current Issues that probably need JavaScript (UI/UX Only)
---

- Color Select
	- The circular color images can't be added to the color choices
		- A background image can be added to the select box (see the pencil icon) but there's no way to add specific images to the individual options.
		- My guess is in JavaScript we can use a transparent image icon and then fill in the color based on a JavaScript variable.
		- Furthermore if we had that feature this shouldn't even be a select box, ideally it would be a text box and the user could input any color he/she chooses.  Since that's not possible with CSS I'm leaving as is for now.
		- I also tried to change the background color when you hover over a select box option.  Oddly enough it seems you can't do this in CSS/HTML.
		- Though it's not in the original design, when we come back to this for the JavaScript course we may consider adding some sort of color picker.

#Current issues that probably can be fixed in HTML/CSS
---

*Complete*
~~- Missing Text Boxes
	- Theres a lot of span/text areas that really should be text boxes and allow user input.  I was focused more on visual aspect and really just didn't pay enough attention to this.  The following text should be input type textbox:
		- Room Name
		- Names 1 - 4
		- Roles (Product Manager, 3D Animator, Concept Artist, Product Manager)~~

- Aligned divs
	- The "roles" div and the "color" div should be equal total height.  This is currently "fixed" by manually changing the margins of id "colors."  Perhaps there's a more eloquent solution, though?

			#roles li{
			    margin-top: 1.3px;
			    margin-bottom: 1.3px;
