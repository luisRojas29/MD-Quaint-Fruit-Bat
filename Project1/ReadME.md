##UI/UX Creation using CSS

FOLDERS:

1.  Images
	- Images that are processed and either complete or good enough for testing.  Integrated into the HTML code/ Webpage.
2. Scalable_GFX
	- Vector based images which allow for further editing/tweaking without quality loss.
3. Original_Images
	- Source Images before they were modified, in the event we have to start over with an image.
